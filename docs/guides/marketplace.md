# Marketplace

The lola market is a federated catalog for discovering and distributing [skills and context modules](../concepts/skills-and-modules.md). Like DNF repositories for Linux packages, marketplaces let you search, install, and update modules from curated catalogs.

## Official Marketplace

We maintain an official, community-driven marketplace at [github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market).

```bash
lola market add general https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market/main/general-market.yml
```

For git-hosted catalogs, you can also pin to a specific branch, tag, or commit SHA:

```bash
# Pin to a release tag
lola market add general https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market.git --ref v1.0.0

# Pin to a commit SHA for maximum reproducibility
lola market add general https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market.git --ref abc1234

# git+https:// and git+ssh:// URLs also supported
lola market add internal git+https://gitlab.internal/org/market.git --ref stable
```

`lola market update` replays the pinned ref automatically — no need to re-specify it.

## Search and Install

```bash
# Search the local registry and all enabled marketplaces
lola search authentication

# Limit to enabled marketplaces only
lola search authentication --market

# Install directly from marketplace (auto-adds and installs)
lola install git-workflow -a claude-code

# Install at a specific git ref (overrides the marketplace-pinned ref)
lola install git-workflow@v1.0.0 -a claude-code

# Install from a specific marketplace at a specific ref
lola install @my-marketplace/git-workflow@v1.0.0 -a claude-code
```

When a module exists in multiple marketplaces, Lola prompts you to select which one to use. The prompt shows each entry's pinned ref so you can make an informed choice.

## Manage Marketplaces

```bash
# List registered marketplaces
lola market ls

# Update marketplace cache
lola market update general

# Update all marketplaces
lola market update

# Disable/enable a marketplace
lola market set --disable general
lola market set --enable general

# Remove a marketplace
lola market rm general
```

## Create Your Own Marketplace

Host a YAML file with this structure:

```yaml
name: My Marketplace
description: Curated collection of AI skills
version: 1.0.0
modules:
  - name: git-workflow
    description: Git workflow automation skills
    version: 1.0.0
    repository: https://github.com/user/git-workflow.git
    tags: [git, workflow]

  - name: monorepo-skills
    description: Skills from a monorepo
    version: 1.0.0
    repository: https://github.com/company/monorepo.git
    path: packages/lola-skills  # Custom content directory
    tags: [monorepo]
```

### Module Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Module name (used as the registry key) |
| `description` | ✅ | Short description shown in search results |
| `version` | ✅ | Version string (informational) |
| `repository` | ✅ | Git URL or archive URL to fetch from |
| `path` | — | Content subdirectory inside the repo (for monorepos) |
| `ref` | — | Git branch, tag, or commit SHA to pin (see below) |
| `tags` | — | List of tags for search/discovery |
| `hooks` | — | Pre/post install scripts |

### Pinning Modules to a Git Revision

Use the `ref` field to pin a module to a specific Git revision for supply-chain reproducibility:

```yaml
modules:
  # Pin to a release tag — stable, auditable
  - name: network-tools
    description: Network troubleshooting skills
    version: 2.0.0
    repository: https://github.com/partner-org/network-skills
    ref: v2.0.0
    tags: [networking]

  # Pin to a commit SHA — maximum reproducibility
  - name: verified-tools
    description: Skills validated at a known commit
    version: 1.2.0
    repository: https://github.com/org/tools
    ref: a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcd
    path: packs/tools
    tags: [tools]

  # Pin to a branch — tracks branch head, less stable
  - name: dev-preview
    description: Skills from the development branch
    version: 0.9.0
    repository: https://github.com/org/tools
    ref: develop
    path: packs/tools
    tags: [preview]
```

`ref` accepts any valid Git reference: branch name, tag, or full/short commit SHA. When omitted, Lola fetches the repository's default branch (unchanged behavior).

Users can override the marketplace-pinned ref at install time:

```bash
# Override the ref defined in the marketplace YAML
lola install network-tools@main
```
